## Hash Tables 


a hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys and it's value in a table called hashing table, by using modulo operator to get a range of key values. and a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. 

Basic operations  : 
Search − Searches an element in a hash table.
Insert − inserts an element in a hash table.
delete − Deletes an element from a hash table.

the big O for the operations are O(n) in most of the times
it mostly used in databases 

## Sets 

a set is any sequence of unique values. they are useful when we have a collection of data, they can be beneficial for storing : 
unique user names in a database 
a unique list of tags 

a set does not have duplicates and the type can be numbered or string or any other datatype ...
since it behaves like an array we can assume that the big O for the set can be O(n) in most of the times



## Binary Trees 
a binary tree is a non-Linear data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.  each node and have no children or one child or two.
The basic operation for the binary tree is Access, serch, insert, Delete
O(log(n)) for every opration, but the worst case is going to  be O(n)


## Tries

## Balancing Binary Trees (AVL Tree)
